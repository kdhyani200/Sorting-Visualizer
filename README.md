# Sorting-Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This tool provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. You can interactively see how different algorithms sort an array of numbers, making it an excellent educational resource for understanding sorting algorithms.

# Features

* Visual Representation: Watch how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.
* Multiple Algorithms: Supports Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.
* Adjustable Speed: Change the speed of the visualization to understand the sorting process better.
* Dynamic Array Size: Adjust the number of elements in the array to see how the algorithms perform on different data sizes.
* Stepped Values: Option to visualize sorting with incremental values, shuffled before sorting.

# Getting Started

 Prerequisites
  * Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
  * Git installed to clone the repository.

Installation
  1. Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/kdhyani200/Sorting-Visualizer.git
  2. Navigate to the project directory : cd Sorting-Visualizer
  3. Compile the java files : javac kd/sorting/*.java
  4. Run the application : java kd.sorting.SortingVisualizer

Usage
  * Start the application.
  * Use the sliders to adjust the speed and size of the array.
  * Select the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
  * Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
  * Check the "Stepped Values" checkbox if you want to sort an array with incremental values.
